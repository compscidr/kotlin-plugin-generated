# kotlin-plugin-generated
A Kotlin compiler plugin that annotates Kotlin-generated methods with `lombok.Generated` to signify to code analyzers
that these methods have been generated by the compiler.

## JaCoCo solution (new)
Please note that JaCoCo recently landed support for recognizing Kotlin-generated
code, so we suggest using one of their snapshots builds (0.8.2-SNAPSHOT+) instead if possible.
It has the advantage of not polluting your code with `lombok.Generated` annotations.

In Gradle, you can do that as follows:

```groovy
repositories {
    // This repository is needed to get the latest snapshot of JaCoCo
    maven { url = "https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots" }
}

jacoco {
     toolVersion = '0.8.2-SNAPSHOT'
}
```

## Gradle
To use the plugin, just apply the plugin in your `build.gradle`:

```groovy
plugins {
    id 'nl.fabianm.kotlin.plugin.generated' version '1.0'
}
```

You can optionally configure the plugin as shown below:

```groovy
kotlinGenerated {
    // The annotation to annotate the generated methods with
    annotation = "lombok.Generated"
    
    // A flag to indicate whether the annotation should be visibile at runtime
    visible = true
}
```
