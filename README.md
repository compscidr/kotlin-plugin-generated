# kotlin-plugin-generated
A Kotlin compiler plugin that annotates Kotlin-generated methods with `lombok.Generated` to signify to code analyzers
that these methods have been generated by the compiler.

## Gradle
To use the plugin, just apply the plugin in your `build.gradle`:

```groovy
plugins {
    id 'nl.fabianm.kotlin.plugin.generated' version '1.0'
}
```

You can optionally configure the plugin as shown below:

```groovy
kotlinGenerated {
    // The annotation to annotate the generated methods with
    annotation = "lombok.Generated"
    
    // A flag to indicate whether the annotation should be visibile at runtime
    visible = true
}
```
