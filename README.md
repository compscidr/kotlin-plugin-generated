# kotlin-plugin-generated
A Kotlin compiler plugin that annotates Kotlin-generated methods with
`lombok.Generated` to signify to code analyzers that these methods have been
generated by the compiler.

## JaCoCo solution (new)
Please note that JaCoCo landed support for recognizing Kotlin-generated
code in 0.8.2, so we advise using that instead if possible.
It has the advantage of not polluting your code with `lombok.Generated` 
annotations.

In Gradle, you can do that as follows:

```groovy
jacoco {
     toolVersion = '0.8.2'
}
```

## Gradle
To use the plugin, just apply the plugin in your `build.gradle`:

```groovy
plugins {
    id 'nl.fabianm.kotlin.plugin.generated' version '1.3.2'
}
```

Make sure you install the version that is compatible with the Kotlin
version you are using:

| **Kotlin** | **Plugin** |
|:----------:|:----------:|
|    1.2.*   |     1.0    |
|    1.3.*   |    1.3.2   |

You can optionally configure the plugin as shown below:

```groovy
kotlinGenerated {
    // The annotation to annotate the generated methods with
    annotation = "lombok.Generated"
    
    // A flag to indicate whether the annotation should be visibile at runtime
    visible = true
}
```

## IntelliJ
To be able to use projects utilizing this plugin within IntelliJ IDEA, 
you need to install the IntelliJ plugin (see [#4](https://github.com/fabianishere/kotlin-plugin-generated/issues/4) for more information). You can find the plugin on the
[Releases](https://github.com/fabianishere/kotlin-plugin-generated/releases) page, labeled `plugin-idea-*.zip`

## Command Line
To use the plugin from the command line, invoke `kotlinc` using the
following command line arguments:

```bash
kotlinc -Xplugin="<path-to-plugin-compiler.jar>" -P plugin:nl.fabianm.kotlin.plugin.generated:annotation="lombok.Generated" -P plugin:nl.fabianm.kotlin.plugin.generated:visible=true ...
```
